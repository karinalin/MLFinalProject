0|I'm not following your explanation re: the law in those situations.|rd3111|askhillarysupporters|1|-1|-1|2016-10|2016-10-27 20:12:03|The difference between drugs and Immigration is that the use of drugs is a personal issue. It's that person's choice to use or not use drugs. The individual is in control in that situation. They can check in to rehab today if they want help, or tomorrow, or ten years from now. For immigration, the individual is not in control. They are powerless over it except for the laws that we have put in place. We can't individually control it. There is no rehab to turn to for help. Only laws that were voted on (mostly) to protect themselves. When you can't protect your self and the laws that were supposed to protect you don't work, then what do you do?

Also, check to make sure popup blocker is enabled, this could be a popup it's blocking. As I said, according to your screenshot, Malwarebytes isn't blocking your reddit profile domain, it's blocking a different website your profile is pointing to when you click it.

0|I still think the recipes for factories take way too much of quite rare materials|TheWombatFromHell|Devoted|1|1|0|2016-09|2016-09-18 21:53:34|Devoted Appreciation Post/Thread Hello Buddies! This one goes out to the admins and all staff who work hard to make devoted for what devoted is. They sure are pretty devoted, eh? Anyways, I'll make this short and simple. I really would like to appreciate all my peeps who make devoted as dank as it is. No other way to put it, really. I love how its a fairly relaxing civilization server instead of CivCraft. Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out.
0|Are you actually defending Hitler?|jamiesg|politics|3|-1|-1|2016-11|2016-11-27 09:11:16|Yeah, why should we care? We only fought Saddam because of the oil. And Poland was already gearing for war with Germany. Plus Poland at the time was in control of parts of Prussia and Silesia and treating the national Germans like shit. The Polish were even killing them. Hitler had every right to invade Poland in my opinion and the only reason we went to war was because the British and French were afraid of Germany threatening their colonial power. But it's really all just a matter of opinion.
