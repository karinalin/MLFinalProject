0|I'm not following your explanation re: the law in those situations.|rd3111|askhillarysupporters|1|-1|-1|2016-10|2016-10-27 20:12:03|The difference between drugs and Immigration is that the use of drugs is a personal issue. It's that person's choice to use or not use drugs. The individual is in control in that situation. They can check in to rehab today if they want help, or tomorrow, or ten years from now. For immigration, the individual is not in control. They are powerless over it except for the laws that we have put in place. We can't individually control it. There is no rehab to turn to for help. Only laws that were voted on (mostly) to protect themselves. When you can't protect your self and the laws that were supposed to protect you don't work, then what do you do?

So I just finished season 2 of the anime, and I am so surprised at how much I connected to it and enjoyed it. I don't usually watch anime and the only other one ive seen was AOT. Anyway, I teared up countless times during the show, and I was so invested in [Anime (Season 1) Spoiler](/a Kirito and Asuna. Like their dedication to each other, and how they would risk their lives and fight through anything in order to be together was something I really resonated with.) So when you guys first experienced it, how did you feel and what was your favorite aspect of SAO?

0|I honestly wouldnt mind if DE decided to take a look at all weapons that were X weapon but worse in every way and give them some unique mechanic so that we dont just have like 20-30 useless weapons compared to the others.,Flatflyer,Warframe,4,-1,-1,2016-10,2016-10-03 13:53:11,Has DE Learned to Work Around Power Creep? Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them.

This one goes out to the admins and all staff who work hard to make devoted for what devoted is. They sure are pretty devoted, eh? Anyways, I'll make this short and simple. I really would like to appreciate all my peeps who make devoted as dank as it is. No other way to put it, really. I love how its a fairly relaxing civilization server instead of CivCraft. Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out.
0|Are you actually defending Hitler?|jamiesg|politics|3|-1|-1|2016-11|2016-11-27 09:11:16|Yeah, why should we care? We only fought Saddam because of the oil. And Poland was already gearing for war with Germany. Plus Poland at the time was in control of parts of Prussia and Silesia and treating the national Germans like shit. The Polish were even killing them. Hitler had every right to invade Poland in my opinion and the only reason we went to war was because the British and French were afraid of Germany threatening their colonial power. But it's really all just a matter of opinion.
